# decision-tree
build a decision tree for a dataset multi-class labels


test the decision tree on MNIST digit dataset

For depths d = 1:6, evaluate the decision-tree on a subset of the MNIST training for digits
1, 3, and 7. Generate a plot showing training error and test error (Y axis) as a function of tree depth (X axis).
