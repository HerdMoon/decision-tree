# decision-tree
build a decision tree for a dataset with multi-class labels


test the decision tree on MNIST digit dataset.(consists of roughly 54,000 training examples and 9,000
test examples of handwritten digits. Each example is a 28*28 grayscale image, which leads to 784 pixels
to use as feature)

For depths d = 1:10, evaluate the decision-tree on a subset of the MNIST training for digits
1, 3, and 7. Generate a plot showing training error and test error (Y axis) as a function of tree depth (X axis).
